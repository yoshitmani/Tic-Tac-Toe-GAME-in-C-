# Tic-Tac-Toe-GAME-in-C-
This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. The game allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If the grid is completely filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
